Brandon good to uh have you here today

Brandon Kesler is the CEO founder of Dev

post uh we have run across each other

and run in the same circles for as long

as I've run draft. Dev I think I've

heard about you guys several years ago

um and then officially we met in person

at a conference recently so excited to

to get to talk to you more give us the

um the quick high level what is Dev post

we'll start there and then I want to

hear more about your background and kind

of how you got into it before we then

get into the the meat of this which

we'll be talking about hackathons yeah

uh first thanks so much for having me

really appreciate it thanks to everybody

for joining so um devpost is a platform

for software competitions um our mission

is to inspire developers to build so

when developers are looking to improve

their craft uh when they're bored when

they're either outside of a company or

inside of a company and looking to come

up with new ideas and be inspired we

want them to come to Dev post and so we

have two products we have a public

hackathon product I think this is most

of what we'll be discussing today um

which is we power most of the world's

hackathons we provide the platform that

makes it easy to run the competition

saves everybody a minimum of half their

time organizing and participating and

then we have a large community that's

Global and uh so we can bring those

people to the competitions in order to

build and be inspired and then the last

is we have a Services team that helps

organize manage Market promote these

competitions the second product is a

private product for hackathons called

Dev post for teams that's for inside

your company for your employees to do

private hackathons and also private

hackathons with your customers yeah I

really want to talk we we'll talk a

little about the private ones at the end

because I think for this audience R

there may be less of uh interesting

thing but I personally am interested in

that so I do want to talk about that

because I think that's something that is

getting more popular and especially when

bigger companies you're seeing it more

but Okay cool so how did you get into

this because from what I see on LinkedIn

you were in media and writing which it's

funny I in similar in college I think

you started some Publications I started

a publication a news College news

publication when I was on my campus and

then somehow I got into software

engineering and you went the other way

and got into starting a business and

eventually you know we so it's funny to

see that um tell me about your

background like how did you get into

this and what what is the pathway to De

Post Yeah in college I start a

publication I started a record label so

um music industry so close I I I would

sign bands get them in the studio

oversee the making of the records

promote a market distribute it and use a

lot of internet for get them out of jail

for cocaine possession you name it uh

that was uh 12 13 years of my life uh

and so um loved it and I really like

working with creative people um helping

their creative projects get out there in

the world but we use technology in

pretty much everything that we did and

so um after 12 13 years of babysitting

artists uh I was I wanted to have a a

product uh that we could build uh that

would would grow and have an impact and

so uh I started seeing these Grassroots

competitions sprouting up on the web

many of them were Technology based some

weren't there was an inspirational one

hey create a software program that

allows Windows to run on the Mac before

Apple let you do that and in weeks there

was like $14,000 collectively

contributed by hundreds of individuals

companies teams working throughout the

night to solve this problem and it was

done in three weeks that was really cool

I was blown away and I started calling

up these people that were doing these

Grassroots competitions and they were

doing them on their blogs and there was

no community so at the time created the

company to be a platform and Community

for these skill competitions and then we

sort of pivoted our way in terms of what

are the kinds of competitions that we're

going to support uh how can we uh Focus

so that our community understands the

types that we're doing and then

eventually we just started focusing on

developer competitions software

competitions and hackathons and since

then that is all we've done is software

competitions uh so um the the thread

between sort of music and having a label

and uh and what we're doing now I think

that you know it's closer to me I think

than than most people might think which

is working with people to be creative

and to build and to make things and to

help Inspire them to do that and get the

word out across both music and then now

technology yeah cool I could geek out on

music stuff and Engineering stuff all

day just because that's also interest of

mine um but I will spare the list

anytime um yeah we'll have to do that

offline uh so let's talk about why

hackathons actually this comes up a lot

in client calls I hear it especially

like so often what I found in our our

calls is that you know a developer

marketing person who is maybe less

technical will kind of have a hard time

understanding like why am I going to put

all the resources together to like

organize this huge event this

competition and then maybe I get some

leads that are maybe just Junior

developers out of it you know like they

have a hard time like Drawing the Line

there and as a software developer myself

I understand the line a little better

but you tell me like what do you hear

from from customers why do they want to

do hackathons what why what are kind of

the good reasons that that people are

doing it what really do they get out of

it yeah for sure so there's two sides

right there's the why do people

participate in them and then why do

people sponsor them uh the people that

participate in them get inspired to

build and they um they learn and they

can improve their craft and it's one

thing to re We Believe content is really

important we do a lot of it you all are

amazing at it and they all work together

but it's not enough in order to you know

you want all of the above you want the

good content there but then you need to

incentivize them and Inspire them to

make so on the developer side you know

look deadlines create urgency that uh

you know that uh developers often can

use uh there are prizes given without

taking intellectual property um you

learn one of the best ways which is

through building not just being in a

classroom but by actual building and um

and they're also fun and they can meet

other people and that sort of thing

scratch these creative itches that they

have on something they might want to

make so those are a lot of the reasons

and then on the on the organizer side

you know there's a there's a metric I

like to to share a lot which is between

5% and

33% of anybody that clicks the register

button for one of our hackathons goes on

to spend days weeks or months building

and submitting so you compare that to

going to a conference to reading one

piece of content alone with nothing else

Etc it blows it away it's between 5% and

onethird of everyone who clicks a button

goes and makes something so I think uh

those in the developer marketing

developer relations Community yes it

does take work makes sense to try and

get help if you can and if not one can

try doing it themselves but the the

value is that you get a community who

actually is incentivized to learn and

build uh in a world that where

everyone's trying to Market to

developers so there are other reasons

but I think those are those are the key

ones I'll just say that you know my

entire history I've heard people say you

know our hackathon over or you know is

is is is our hackathons out and and they

just they grow every single year because

it's not a gimmick it's just um really

trying to give something to people in

order to um you know which is an

incentive in order to to try and learn

and build with your tool yeah I love it

I so you said a few things there that

I'll I'll kind of double down on just

being former developer and having been

really um in their head space the big

one is one of our big jobs as software

developers is never stop learning and I

think sometimes people outside of the

software development world don't realize

how much that is true for software

developers because the tools are

constantly changing and in today's world

I mean we got AI stuff coming it's just

it's not stopping you know there's not a

like there's not some magical threshold

where now all the tools have been built

and we're just going to make Sofer the

same way for 100 years like is

constantly changing and so one of the

big challenges I had as a developer was

staying on top of the latest things and

getting the excuse to try the latest

things because you can't do it all at

work in production you know you've got

to have some time to experiment with

things that is outside of that and

that's where hackathons can be really

really interesting and compelling for a

software developer to join at any level

of experience and again like a lot of

times when people ask me about

hackathons they say was it all just

Junior developers who are trying to

build their portfolio like absolutely

not like I as a anybody with five or 10

years of experience still needs to keep

doing that I mean you can't stop

learning um so I think that's that's a

really important thing and the other

thing I would say for the the sponsors

is to me it comes down to trust and it's

honestly the same kind of thing that we

do with our content and that anybody in

developer marketing is trying to improve

is how do I build a stronger

relationship with better trust between

our product and our users and a

hackathon is a way for people in a low

stress environment or kind of a fun

environment to build something build up

Trust with your product and see it in

action and then it becomes so much

easier than you know bring that into the

company because you've already built

something with it so I think it's a a

really compelling and interesting

exciting way to kind of get the word out

and try something new yeah and there's

two things you said that I think are

interesting one is and you mentioned

this in the previous question this idea

of younger or or Junior developers so

we're fortunate to power uh on our

platform the majority of college

hackathons around the globe we work with

our partners mlh were terrific and we we

think it's super important to be

reaching developers when they're start

me look I I got my first American

Express card when I was a fresh my first

day at school at campus and had it ever

since there's this idea of going exactly

like the two people on this webinar

started early so we uh we think that's

really important to get people when

they're Junior but I will say the

overlap in our community and I love them

I think in-person college hackathons are

incredible for um they're more fun um

and there's a lot of community around

them and you get people earlier there's

not a lot of overlap in our community

between those that participate in

in-person college hackathons and our

professional um hackathons they they

like that Community they want to be

doing what their friends are doing they

have a million different things and so

there truly is a separate Community for

the most part it's as people you know

are older and and working professionally

and we've been doing this for like 12 13

years so you know as that you

matriculate out of college they start

participating and those are the ones

that participate in the professional

hackathons they have jobs they're

generally employed they're interested in

learning these tools so that they can

become better developers and upskill and

you know the vast majority are employed

one thing you did mention AI I just

think it's important to say never in my

career have I seen anything change or

transform hackathons like AI has almost

every hackathon that we are doing has

some AI component and um that's because

if you can't just talk about AI you've

got to Tinker and build and experiment

in order to uncover the value and so

hackathons plus AI is uh is really quite

exploded like nothing I've ever seen

yeah I'm glad you mentioned that I

actually had that on my notes to come

back to so let's definitely come put

back put it in back and come back okay

um what are they not good for because I

actually get this question sometimes

from especially and I'll just put some

context I hear it from early stage

startups a lot they're like man it's

going to take a lot of time and

resources and the payoff period might be

long like should I be doing hackathons

early on and I always I mean I have some

opinions but I think you probably have

more informed opinions and so i' I'd

want to hear from you Brandon like

what's it not an answer for no no one

channel is a Panacea no you know

nothing's perfect like when do you tell

people maybe you're not ready for

hackathon I think two things one is the

structure if what you want as an output

um is that you want to own the

applications like you're using it as a

procurement thing you know like oh I

want someone to build this thing for me

I'm going to run a hackathon get I'm

tons of people are going to like do it

I'll submit I'll pick the best and get

it on the cheap bad idea uh that's not a

hackathon we we don't let them on our

platform you know um and and it's not a

hackathon that's a procure that's a

cheap procurement that some people think

is about spec work and that kind of

thing so we see people come in with

those that that's not a good reason to

do it it's not that you want to own the

applications you know Apple doesn't want

to own the app on their iPhone they just

want you to build on iOS so that they

can grow their ecosystem so that's one

in terms of like the stages no we we we

think hackathons are are are great with

early stages just expectations should be

lower you know um I think one thing

we'll probably get to is what makes a

great hackathon what are those

components and maybe at that time I'll

share more about you know what those

things might be and they probably relate

to how Junior you are in certain places

but if the expect ations are relatively

low we don't think hackathons are just a

one-off marketing event they should just

be an ongoing Outreach that you're doing

you're doing it regularly we have a new

feature we want to incentivize people to

do it we're going to have another

quarterly hackathon or you know every

six months hackathon not a one-off so

that you're constantly growing that and

they also to this last point on this is

they work great as an umbrella

initiative over the other things you're

doing so you're going to conferences

you've got content um you're streaming

you're doing all kinds of things and you

can have a virtual hackathon where when

you're doing those efforts you send them

to hey check this out you can win a or b

and get technical support and that kind

of thing so expectations are lower but

absolutely would not discourage smaller

companies I think in some ways it's it's

it's crucial yeah you said a a thing

that I point people to a lot in

developer marketing and developer

relations which is that it's not one

channel and you have to stop kind of

break with your thought that one channel

is what's going to make us win in the

long run if you look at all the the

biggest companies that do Dev tools it's

like multi Channel Omni Channel whatever

you want to call that right it's they do

events and those are built off of like

conference talks that are made from blog

posts which then you know the ideas they

get at conferences feed into more blog

posts which then feeds into what we can

do with our product and hackathons

around the product and then what people

build there gives them ideas for blog

post it's like this you really got to

have some people that understand how to

tile that together and kind of use one

channel to then generate ideas for other

channels essentially um and not you know

it's like I don't I don't like to to

tell somebody you have to do all that or

else it's not worth doing anything it's

not that black and white but it's more

like how can you kind of get two or

three channels set up that feed each

other and I think again hackathons are a

great place to start from like let's

generate content off those hackathons

let's generate product ideas off the

hackathons let's you know like just all

that and as well as community building

and then you can have an internal

community based off of the work that's

done there things like that that's

that's really cool definitely the very

first step in a hackathon after you

register is going to be go sign up for

our to get our API or our developer to

read this content and this tutorial by

the way we have this educational content

in case you're interested here's our

Discord or whatever it is to join that

and all of a sudden you're when you're

incentivizing them there are some prizes

there are cool initiatives you're trying

to get them to do to inspire them you

now bring in all that other stuff

totally

y so you you alluded to this and this

was on my list of questions Let's Do It

um what makes a good hackathon are there

like five or six key components because

I could see people doing the DIY route

at least their first time to try it

maybe they're not sure if they want to

invest big into it and I could see it

being one of those efforts that quickly

snowballs into how much there is

involved like what are some of the

Highlight things that you guys point out

like kind of separate those that sort of

don't really go as well as people

playing versus the ones that really take

off yeah so every hackathon is different

every compan is different every product

is different there is no like you will

get X Y or Z exact numbers afterwards

these are these are initiatives but the

uh We've looked back through all of the

data and we've noticed that there are

four things that you know push things to

the higher ranges of outcomes one is

promotion marketing if people don't hear

about this they're not going to register

or submit it's just a fact so with our

customers we have a really large

community uh in the millions we we um

let our community know and also

encourage our customer to let their

Community know and to re-engage their

existing developers uh really the more

that they hear about it the better

because developers as you know are busy

in demand have a million things going

and they're marketing averse they block

ads in their browser more than any other

professional group but yet they're

building our future and they are

interested in learning about valuable

tools so you know it's important to

reach them and so that that's one which

is promotion um the second is that the

competition should be interesting uh

this is a bit of Art and Science but um

it really means that there's a product

that is valuable that's going to really

help people and there's enough of them

out there to help uh we've done

competitions that focus on

bioinformatics groups at medical schools

that's fine it's just going to be

smaller if you're looking for larger

numbers a product should be uh you know

valuable in a in a big enough market and

as for the themes we can work on on that

whether they go big or whether they go

broad but generally that's what makes

something interesting um the third is

that there's tech support so if people

start using a tool and they get stuck

and there's nobody that can help them

then they're going to bounce and then

the last is fair prizes which can be a

broad range but it really depends on the

ask and uh who one is going after uh but

if you add up first second third some

honorable mentions you know and you

think about developers time and what

it's worth um you know there should be

prizes that are fair it doesn't have to

all be cash to can be in prizes and

meetings and stuff like that so those

four things the marketing that the

competition is interesting that there's

sufficient tech support and fair prizes

are really what would give you the best

best chances So to that question earlier

about you know if you're just starting

out promotion might be a little bit

harder because maybe they don't have a

community and we're introducing people

to the first time doesn't mean that it

shouldn't be done just lower

expectations to uh to some degree uh in

terms of the competition being

interesting does doesn't mean that it's

necessarily any less interesting there

just might be name recognition like that

and they're going to make have to make

sure there's enough prizes and that

there's tech support uh and but if those

things are in place I think it's great

yeah I was going to ask about the the

tech support and maybe specifically like

the documentation side of things right

because I this actually comes up with us

a lot we we tell clients like we can't

really go write great tutorials and do

video tutorials for you if you don't

have any like docs like you have to have

some basic level documentation or

something that even if it's we've done

it occasionally internal docs that we

just you know kind of gave us enough of

a working Point what's what's you all's

kind of minimum threshold that you

recommend I there's probably like a

minimum threshold just to get by but

then there's probably like a recommended

threshold of like if you really want

people to to take this seriously you're

going to have to give them a little more

to go on um what would you kind of say

to that like how much does a company

need to have as well as as far as

documentation and support available

that's a great question I think one way

to frame it in the hackathon is to

actually explain where the company is

you know we've been around this long our

documentation explains a b and c we're

interested in improving it and looking

for your feedback and can certainly ask

that as part of the hackathon as well so

as long as there's sort of

straightforward explanation of where one

company is there isn't necessarily a

hard and fast rule sure the better the

documentation the clearer it is then the

more time people will save and the less

chance they have to jump but if I had to

answer that I would probably say you

know obviously a description of end

points and how one uses it and then at

the very least that that is you know

minimum there needs to be some

documentation I would be shocked if it's

rare that we we don't see that happen it

might be that it could be improved but

there generally is something and then

something to explain you know where

you're actually seeing or reading how

one might use it with potentially some

sample code and get to Hell world or

something similar like that I think

those are generally uh Basics and then

beyond that is is gravy uh but you know

what about you what do you see so yeah I

I think that for us when when when I

think about like the the things that we

need in documentation we do need like at

least the the endpoints available and

what what they're going to do right some

idea there but I think some some people

have had as as sort primitive a a

collection as like a postman collection

which you know you can work from like if

just you know we all know how to

download Postman and use it and then on

the other hand we've had others where

they've already got whole libraries of

tutorials and getting started guys and

they're looking to kind of next level up

their content right like go to the next

level and I think what you said is

exactly right it's like I think of

content in the the sort of priority list

for content in for terms of what are the

most core essential things you need

versus the things that you only do once

you're huge and the things you only do

once you're huge are things like um

you're writing about SEO related topics

that are completely underated to your

product but there might be a tiny bit of

crossover with your core user group

right um and when you're a massive

publicly traded company you can

absolutely do that when you're a little

smaller you don't start there right like

that you start with what's our product

do um and so that that sort of core

level documentation is really important

the hard part I find and this is you

know again goes back to your point about

like be honest with where you're at is

earlier stage companies are often

changing their products so quickly that

it's very hard for them to document or

keep it up to date and I imagine that

comes up in hackathons but that said I

imagine again this happens with

hackathons it's like we often will tell

a client hey look we figured out this

tutorial we got it working but your docs

were out of date and this thing was

wrong and this is how it actually works

and then they'll sort of we give them

that feedback to to update sure that

comes up in hackathons too so definitely

it can be good even if you aren't as

mature yeah and and I I think that's

really the minimum I I would say one

other thing that's worth uh doing we

encourage as part of the hackthon are

you know office hours or a type of live

stream office hour web it could be

Discord office hours it could be um a

video but where you're just saying okay

right you've seen that maybe or you've

watched that maybe but what's your

specific question and people can kind of

get more one-on-one help at that time so

there is effort involved um in you know

hackathon of course it's never going to

be said it or forget it I don't think

it's different for any other any other

marketing initiative yeah okay so

another one that comes up that I I'm

always curious about and I don't

remember who I talked to about this

recently but what do you do when your

product is kind of a one-trick pony and

here's an example like authentication um

I don't want to demean authentication

it's an extremely essential service to

any dev's workflow and any you know

back-end product and front end product

just like you got to have it but it's

also hard for me at this point to

creatively think of like what's a good

hackathon around authentication is it

even a hackathon worthy type product or

you know and how does that work or how

have you guys seen that get creative

because again this is that Art and

Science and you don't have to come up

with an example based on authentication

on the fly but like with other onetick

Pony or like smaller tools that seem so

narrow how do you come up with ideas

like that so we have several hackathons

with OCTA um and so I've got one I'm

going to put it in the chat but if if

you go to devpost decom and you type in

Octa in search there's an example right

there which is about that and so in this

case and we've done several um but

that's a really great question which is

what if you have a tool and it's kind of

binary it's just on or off it's not how

creatively are you necessarily using it

it's just like have you installed it or

not should you then do a hackathon yeah

we do them all the time yeah sure it

takes a little bit more creativity in

this case we talked about AI uh that is

generally what is happening these days

because you um you can build something

that requires that you use the basic

tool we also work with hosting companies

Mo most of them too and it's like okay

you're hosted by them but then what um

and so it's very common to do that so we

work with you on something that's

creative I would say in general these

days probably something that's AI

related I can give a little bit more

about that which is by AI related that

doesn't necessarily mean like um here's

a data set and optimize it these days

most of it is sort of generative Ai and

um really trying to say well okay how

can you move something interesting

forward uh with a baseline of using our

tool um yeah so that there's an example

there happy to happy to go deeper if

interested no that's helpful and I think

yeah giving people like you examples is

they can go search for that's perfect

because uh I knew you guys had worked

with with OCTA and other off providers I

imagine along the way and that's it just

to me it's like it's so interesting to

think about like any tool can be you

know in real life it's going to be

applied many ways and so the question is

how do we generate interesting

constraints so that it can be applied in

different creative ways in a hackathon

and I think that's that's kind of a fun

thing to think about um okay Co I'll add

one more thing you know that um I I

promise I'm not trying to slip this in

for uh purposes other than um uh we

talked about the private hackthon

product I agree that private hackthon

with for your employees is not relevant

but I do want to talk about something um

we have a case study coming out really

soon which is private hackathons with

your customers this very much is in the

dev relations world or um for sales

prospects Etc and um as we all know

lately with the changes that have been

happening in the industry a lot of devel

is moving more toward Revenue not just

toward longtail in general so I I

actually think it's useful um so um if

you have key accounts and anybody in

devell could be sales Engineers could be

sales people could be other teams in

marketing but often we're seeing Dev

relations people working with key

accounts running hack accounts with one

or more key accounts on dev post for

teams which is private because let's

just say Dropbox who was be on this like

they're not going to want to show

whatever they're working on in a public

setting um that's actually um been

fantastic lately and a really great use

case so it is Dev relations related

which is if any of you are either are or

are working with people on your key

accounts you wanted to get them to build

whether they're prospective customers or

customers I would consider private

hackathons all the same things that

we've said here apply the same stuff

with content the same thing with um well

how to structure hackathon and more yeah

I think the um this is something we

actually I kind of draw a parallel in

content this comes up often too where um

sometimes people sort of start to run

out of what they think are the like most

obvious public facing I don't know

content pieces that they can do but

something that often unlocks this is

like when you think about your biggest

customers or your biggest prospects

right now what is one thing that if they

saw it like we could write about it or

we could demonstrate it would sort of

unlock them and be like oh I see like

this is this is how I'd use the product

or this makes it so easy for me to

implement that I'm ready to go and I

think that kind of goes to your same

point it's like what could we sort of

show the customer we can build for them

or with you know with our Tool uh is a

really cool way to like encourage that

kind of just get that conversation

moving and the Creative Juice is flowing

and give it's it's almost like you need

to unlock enough time for them to just

think about it really deeply and and I

think that can be valuable and don't

right I want to make sure I'm

understanding um maybe you can rephrase

that a little bit more for me I

understood what you're saying that

sometimes just being able to say here's

how you can use the tool or here's a key

uh selling point that can unlock it but

maybe you can take in a little bit

deeper in terms of what like for for us

for example like say you are a a

database type company you've got some

kind of backend as a service or database

often a client might come to them and

say hey does this work for e-commerce

and it's like yeah technically it can

work for anything it's agnostic right

but like they want to what they mean is

I want to see an example in e-commerce

and I want to see an example that

integrates with my front end that I've

already like built out you know things

that like sort of show them not just

that it does work but show them in it's

working you know it's like here's a a

demonstration in practice what that

allows them to do because often like the

buyer might be different from the

implementer so what that can allow them

to do is the the customer who's the the

buyer can kind of show their implement

or their engineering team like hey this

is valuable and here's how they use it

or they demonstrate that it can be used

so again like back end of the service is

an example showing more front-end

Integrations or showing more ways that

it can be used in specific ways sort of

helps unlock certain buyers that maybe

got stuck because their their

engineering team was a little more

skeptical got it yeah and so was there

um question around how hackathons could

potentially or just more of well tie in

was more just observation like it's the

same idea like you're building this

internal hackathon with a customer you

kind of get that same level of unlock

where you're able to build out things

that people you know maybe just imagined

but you're actually put into practice I

think that's a terrific point and I see

what you're getting at there yeah

actually this one that this case study

that'll be coming out soon and I can

mention it's with sap and a bunch of

their customers actually um there was an

instance where again this is public

information publicly approved

information where there was a senior

person in the room who had heard about

it authorized stuff but had not actually

messed around with the tool had not

actually touched it and so getting them

to build with your tools um really does

pay dividends I couldn't agree more yeah

um so let's talk about promoting a

hackathon and obviously the big

Advantage working with you guys not you

know not to oversell it but like having

this big community of like publicly you

know ready to go software Engineers is

is massively valuable I can see that but

you know what do I do if I'm a company

that doesn't have that or doesn't have

the resources yet to work with you um

are there any best practices I know it's

not magic like you know you can post

about it on Twitter you can try to run

ads I'm sure you can try to do some

things like what really works what do

you try to to encourage companies to do

besides just working with you guys yeah

everything uh everything you possibly

can so um certainly if you're working

with a company then H having them let

their Community know and the way we do

that is through email also through

Discord and on our site featured

hackathons and when people sign up to

Dev post they um say what their skills

are and their interests are and then we

target them based on that um let them

know about hackathons that are relevant

to them so that's really big with our

full marketing package we're we're

bringing the majority of submitters the

vast majority of the time uh but on the

customer side regardless of whether

you're working with somebody or not

absolutely letting your community know

um that could be prospects that could be

existing developers already just

re-engaging them and letting them know

uh and then encouraging them to let

other people know um Partnerships always

work well uh so if there if you can have

usually a small limited number of

Partners to help spread the word hey

we'll we'll link to your API or your

developer tools on our resources page in

exchange for you letting Community know

maybe contributing some prize money

that's an option um you want to be

careful in our experience not to have

too many partners with tools because the

more requirements that you have to build

right uh within competition and the

fewer submissions there will be you want

to try to keep it as easy as possible

and so and then of course website um

ensuring that it's promoted on all the

websites it there's nothing uh

particularly unique it's just making

sure that everybody knows through email

through social channels through any

real-time Community um through any

partner website and um also ensuring

that what you tell them is valuable

here's yeah what you'll learn here's

what the deadline is here are what you

can win uh all of these things are

really important um and that's just

promoting it in the first place then

once they've registered there's a whole

other group of things to get them to

actually submit right because you want

to make sure that they follow through

all the way which is a you know multi

multi-step process they're going to

build a little app they're going to have

to submit it within the requirements and

time time span so I imagine there is

there like a a best practice there do we

do like a daily follow-up a weekly

follow-up like what do you usually

recommend yeah so it's easy to register

it's click a button essentially form and

you've registered but now finding time

in my life to build and come up with an

idea idea and get it working and just

submit it is that's the tough part

that's why we like aons because as we

said between five% and a third of them

actually go on and do that which we

we're blown away by um but yeah the

tricks are not daily check-ins

definitely not um uh developers hate

hate email and uh uh but but got them

know still got to let them know trying

to get them into um you know your

slacker your Discord or whatever your

using could be useful for those that

actually want to do it um and just being

helpful hey there's a month to the

deadline there's two weeks to the

deadline or we have a week here and by

the way we're doing these office hours

we have this information or this content

for you to do trying to be as helpful as

possible and then um that's just to let

them reminders and then we do suggest a

couple check-ins which is just are you

submitting on De post it's part of our

uh we set it up for our manage hack

founds to be part of the offering which

are check-ins and can kind of get a

sense how are you planning to submit or

not which gives us a better sense of

that yeah let's talk too about

incentives um because I imagine that's

kind of part of the promotion it kind of

ties in together right like I want to

promote it but I also have to tell

people what are they going to get if

they win or what are the top prizes what

are the the kind of layers of tiers we

could get um what have you guys found

works really well for incentive and you

know is money the best motivator or is

it the answer is probably it depends

like what does it depend on yeah so we

tell people wide range of between 10 and

$50,000 in prizes we've done them in the

millions and hundreds of thousands we've

had them without them competitions to

get a meeting with Michelle Obama for

example things like this um so it's uh

you know or a political figure or or an

interesting figure in general so it

really depends and again you got to

think about well if there's a first

place there's a second place or a third

place you know um that as well we

encourage a mix of cash and in kind

prizes we do think cash is important you

don't have to but it is more common and

it's more of a sign of respect for their

time that they're putting into it think

of all the people that don't win in

their time so this is just for the few

that do um and on in kind prizes it

depends if it's a corporate competition

like um like either a private one or one

geared toward Enterprise it might be

more about conference tickets exposure

to other customers exposure to the

executives potentially promise meetings

with Venture firms there um that kind of

a thing so it it depends um swag's

always a good thing to have credits is

pretty much a no-brainer where if you

have a product that costs money you're

gonna have to give them out anyway uh so

it's really a mix trying to think about

what's interesting and what kind of

developer you're trying to attract and

it's not just prizes as as we talked

about earlier there's other elements of

hackathons that matter a lot which is

deadlines and then there's a competitive

spirit and it's not so much about

beating other people it's really like a

marathon you're trying not to win the

New York Marathon you just want to set a

goal and accomplish it so uh there is

something something to be said for that

as an incentive too which I think is

unique to to ha I like the idea of the

incentives being kind of relevant for

the the the hackathon or the part the

product or the something you know like

some way like tied in so if it's you

know AWS throw in a hackathon they give

you free tickets to some event they're

doing in your your city or whatever like

that kind of thing makes a lot of sense

because it's kind of like building that

that cycle um the other thing I'll say

this kind of mirrors my experience with

draft. Dev we have 350 or so writers all

software Engineers that write for us

just nights and weekends on the side

basically and of course we pay them all

for their work but honestly for a lot of

them especially more senior ones the

money is not the needle mover it's they

get credit on the other you know

people's websites they get to learn

about Cool Tools they get to write for

some of their favorite companies um and

so it's it's like uh yes I believe in

like rewarding people for their time and

and you know like cash is a little part

of that but also it's important to think

about like what really motivates the the

kind of people who are going to do this

and like like a meeting with Michelle

Obama like that's no amount of money can

get you that right like I mean I guess

some amount of money maybe does but like

it's very hard like it's not something I

would be able to go do on my own whereas

you know 300 bucks I can make 300 bucks

in a couple hours if I'm a software

developer so it's like a little less of

a a mover yeah and and and you're and

that was also an extreme example but

there are um there could be me so a

typical example would be right so it's a

company hackathon getting your work in

front of the executives or getting help

with intellectual property and patent

development or these kinds of things

matter it is definitely worth about you

know yes I I think you're 100% right we

just think about the product be creative

with the product and think about the

audience um but but I I money is there's

a menu different people have uh

motivations so some people really only

care about the cash others don't in

general it's a mix you don't want to

spend all this time and and not get

anything so uh it really it really just

depends yeah that's a good point it also

comes down to budget at the end at the

end of the day it's the customer how

much do they have available and then we

make it work within that and so much of

the time it's that there was something I

was talking to Richard on your team

recently about hackathons and one thing

he pointed out which I never would have

thought of and I think this is worth

mentioning just because if I never

thought of it then I'm sure some people

listening here would never thought of it

is there are some legal implications to

paying out prizes to people all over the

world and often these have like like you

point out most hackathons are remote but

there are there are actual like laws and

requirements of how you can and can't

pay people in certain countries in areas

and so tell me you don't have to go

through any detail there but tell me

high level like you know what have you

guys learned about that what what is

anybody throwing their own hackathon

need to know about that you mean how in

Brazil you have to give out gold bars as

prizes not joke he

told so yeah so uh we uh we are we are

experts at that um and so from a project

Pro Management standpoint and I see that

there's a question about our offering

happy to get to that during the QA Q&A

if that matter if that's interesting but

um yes so um we have different levels of

project management but in general we

cover the rules and we cover prize

fulfillment um for pretty much all three

of the packages that we offer for

project management and then there's

varying levels of how involved we get in

everything from helping people

encouraging them to submit in reviewing

their submissions uh and more so and

spreading the word but yeah uh you've

got to be careful you don't want to

change the the rules unless you

absolutely have to and if you do you

have to let everybody know a lot of

in-person hacked conss to be frank don't

really they're fast and they play you

know fast and loose with rules because

it's like in person and a few people or

whatever but on we're talking virtual

Global competitions in general you these

are there's fairness and there's laws

about this and you have to be fair and

so you can't just say oh we're going to

give a prize to this person even though

our rules said X or Y so working with an

organization that can help you with that

makes a lot of sense yeah I I just was

you know as I was talking to Richard BR

he's telling about the legal and like

the amount of Hoops you're going through

with certain countries and stuff it's

like man that alone is like a reason to

Outsource that just because being an

entrepreneur I I hate legal stuff it's

just it's like one of those things that

just slows you down and I know why it's

there it's all good but um you know it's

never a fun thing to deal with right so

anyway uh good to know and definitely

good to um look into especially if

you're going to do remote you're going

to be paying people around the world

know what the right way to do that is

and to run a competition that is seen as

a legal competition you know like you

said the rules are are very clear and

not changed and doesn't fall into that

like gambling or something yeah yes

exactly you don't want to go up all

these rules are there because they don't

want the gambling they don't want you be

confused with the gambling folks so but

I would say in general it's not so bad

and um it's worth it if you want to do a

virtual hackathon that's scalable you

reaching more Enterprise developers have

more time to work on their applications

they're going to be more polished versus

sort of you know raw prototypes and uh

that's those are the advantages why it's

worth doing yeah yeah Steve um asked a

question I was goingon to ask so I'll

start with this one Clayton but I think

yeah let's get into some questions here

um what metrics would you use for a

hackathon success and I'm gonna guess

the answer is it depends on the

organization what your goals are Etc but

what are some things you see commonly

absolutely so generally there's going

the number of uh folks that that sign up

and participate so how many participants

you have that's going to really uh That

Matters to people again differs based on

how new the company is ETC what the

prizes are how well they're run and put

together these kinds of things but uh

you know the reason people are doing

this to grow their developer Community

that's one of them the other is to

actually engage them to get them build

so that would be the number of projects

and they don't just look at quantity

they look at quality so uh we we use uh

input metrics as a framework along with

with objectives and key results okrs and

the input metrics for us um are around

how easy are we making it to submit and

um and then ultimately um what are the

things that we can do to drive quantity

and quality of submissions which are

some of the key outputs so a developers

in the community that you've B um the

projects now there's additional stuff

and it does depend but you can get

product feedback so you have all these

people going through this flow and using

your product that's valuable feedback to

give to yourct team or Engineers Etc

right um hiring is uh for us on um

Enterprise hackathons is sort of less of

a thing but it certainly happens all the

time you can reach out to these people

with their permission uh if you're

interested from a recruiting standpoint

um those are more but that those are the

big ones yeah gr develop community and

and the quality and quantity of

applications or projects that are built

I wouldn't have immediately thought of

the hiring one but that actually makes a

lot of sense too it's like you know

they're getting familiar with your

product and you're they're kind of

having a touch point with your your team

and so if they do have the skills that

you're looking for makes sense to to

reach out um yeah let's talk about Ai

and then also kind of dovetails into one

of the questions here which is about

like how are hackathons changing and

evolving and I think um there's there's

lots of ties to AI but there's probably

other things that you see on the horizon

there what what do you see is like the

future of hackathons obviously we don't

think they're dying or going away but

like what could be different about them

or how's AI impacting them what are you

seeing I think AI is impacting them in

every single way from the tools that

people are using which can now to some

degree think for themsel not everything

has to be uh programmatically created it

can be through learning reinforcement

and that's reinforcement learning and

that's that's actually huge we're seeing

that in the tools we're also just seeing

in Opportunities and we've already begun

on this um to save people time with

hackathons so actually our users tell us

they sometimes spend up to 20 hours

sometimes as much as they do building

thinking of what their idea should be

which is shocking to me uh but it's true

and so for some people um helping um

come up with ideas and um we have some

that are already live now on this um is

is a really useful tool which is to help

save time for that um and so um but you

know there's so much more from improving

team building uh to um summarizing the

results of a hackathon for everybody so

it could be in both the management but

then also in the creation of what you're

actually building so I think it's

tremendous I don't think it's going away

it's like the invention of the personal

computer in in in many of you people

like myself uh but it is early and so I

think one note on AI is that comp some

companies are like yeah no we're not

touching this right now we have to

figure out more things around data

privacy and of course there's

responsible AI we've done a bunch of

competitions focused on respons AI so I

think that's going to be the the biggest

bet which is that um they'll be um it'll

be easier to participate in a hackthon

and and also create a project the last

thing that I think is absolutely

important is that now you have people

that aren't developers who are able to

participate in hackathons uh you know

anybody can come up with improvements um

using a chat interface which then is GNA

obviously change and grow in many ways

and I think it'll be much easier to

create applications uh think of low code

no code uh you know to uh exponential

Improvement yeah I'm I'm very interested

and and overall bullish on the fact that

AI low code lots of all I'm just going

to put all those into they are like

higher level abstractions of code

because ultimately they're they're

generating code way deep down but but

like you see less and less of the code

to inter interact with the the machine

right um all of those are so impactful

for just allowing creative interesting

ideas to come to life fast F and with

fewer resources and people often will

talk about how that means the that means

developers AR be needed it's like well

somebody's creating all these tools that

are higher level abstractions first of

all but second of all each idea spawns

its own ecosystem of ideas and

complimentary things I think and that's

how software is always done if it were

true that higher level abstractions

destroy the need for software developers

then C++ would have destroyed the need

for software developers and it didn't it

only expanded so there's just you know

what software developers write or how

what it looks like might change over

time to some extent but like people who

understand how computers work and how

they get you know information around

each other and all that is they're gonna

be even more cenal and so anyway I I'm

excited about seeing that too yeah yeah

and for those that are looking to

upskill you know in AI I think

hackathons are a great way to great way

to do it to mess around tinker and have

a deadline for on self and actually get

it done and accomplish that yeah um two

two more things I want to touch on

private uh hackathons because we we've

been kind of hinting at that let's talk

about that really quick and then the

last thing will be kind of budgeting and

then you know what it's like to engage

with you guys versus DIY version so uh

let's what's a typical use case what are

companies trying to get out of a private

hackathon and how's it a little

different from the public one yeah so

setting aside um the employees within

your company the engineers um because

that's a sort of somewhat of a different

topic although for any who's listening

their company does Acton

uh we save them tremendous amount of

time grow participation if you think

about all the employees and their

salaries and the value of their time

it's it's worth it that's a subscription

product we charge by the seat um but no

it's customer hackathons is the is the

it's really what I said earlier so I

probably don't even need to spend too

much time about it other than to say

that if you have um you know customers

key accounts and um you want to

incentivize them in the same way um then

you use Dev post for teams for that and

we also have these built-in templates

where you can save a hackathon and

launch one with one click it comes with

like 15 or 20 existing templates for

hackthon and anybody can spin them up so

for that you don't even need Services

we'll help you with stuff but it's

actually self- served for your customers

and your employees and that's what

devpost for teams are it's private

Totally Secure you can get in through

SSO you can't use your devpost dcom

account to get into it totally different

um and we we're working on it because

it's uh there would been tremendous

amount of requ starting with the

pandemic and moving onward to where

there's now been this big focus on

shifting to revenue and customers so

that's that's why cool um okay let's

talk about cost so let's pretend I'm

gonna set up yeah let's sorry let's talk

about cost so pretend I'm gonna set up

my own hackathon and I have myself and

Clayton we're going to be the ones

running it ourselves right let's take

you know we're gonna spend for our time

whatever that is and you can give me an

estimate on what that might be but then

what all what other costs are involved

there the prize cost the like what's the

typical range of budgets that that a

company might spend sure so um we have a

couple different packages we have

packages for uh project management which

is US assisting with the competition

those are for the most part required and

then we have three packages for

marketing promotion those are optional

it really depends on whether you want

that um uh you're you're looking at 10K

at the minimum and 80k at the maximum

depending on what you want to do for

both marketing and project management um

if you want to do everything yourself we

will we we can just give you the

platform alone that's exceptionally rare

but it's possible uh we just want to

make sure that the rules are good and

that's why we do the rules and the prize

fulfillment because we want to make sure

that there's a quality there um by the

way if you're running an in-person

hackathon it's free you can just use our

platform for any inperson event and

that's how we sign up between three and

5,000 developers every week and grow

this community because we're powering

all of these Grassroots competitions

around the globe so that's generally and

then in terms of prizes you know 10 to

50K range is encouraged it can be higher

it can be lower it's just that's

generally what we what we tell people if

you're looking at like 10K On The Low

End plus whatever prizes you want to

give and 80k at the highend plus

whatever prizes you can give unless

you're running everything yourself which

would be less than that it's around

$3,000 for the month okay gotcha yeah so

and then they typically run for a month

or so just uh yeah usually there's a

submission period of about six weeks um

but it can be shorter it can be longer

cool okay um well Brandon we're at time

so I won't um keep everybody extra long

this has been super helpful just a out

of my own curiosity I love to learn

about anything Dev marketing this is a

whole Space I've never run a hackathon

I've never had to you know be the one in

charge of it so it's cool to learn um

and I'm sure for listeners too this is

going to be really interesting and

insightful where can people go to find

out more about you or ask you questions

I assume devpost do.com is the best

starting point but anything else you

want to plug deos.com

uh feel free to email me Brandon at as

well anytime you have any questions and

um thank you so much for having me

really appreciate the conversation

thanks to everybody for the questions

too yeah absolutely thanks for joining

everybody
